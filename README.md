# WaveletNeuralNetwork
Wavelet Neural Network implementation in Theano

Implementation follows http://maths.york.ac.uk/www/sites/default/files/Veitch.pdf and uses gaussian wavelet function.

Data set is collected from HERE Maps API , The input data is the Jam Factor , Confidence Factor  , and Time Taken to travel of the contributing roads, and the target output is the Jam Factor of the parent road.

The complete raw dataset is the anndata.csv file.
